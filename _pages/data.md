### Data on the South Korean Congress (1948-2016)

##### <p><style="color: #82E0AA">\*</a></p>Please feel free to contact me if you are interested in the data  

With support from the College of Humanities and Social Sciences at Utah State University, data on over 63,900 legislative bills and 4,700 unique legislator-terms in South Korea from 1948 to 2016 (the 1st to 19th Congress) were collected and categorized through web scraping and supervised machine learning.

- Information for legislative bills includes: congress number, bill title, proposal dates, decision dates, bill category, decision, sponsors, co-sonsors, proponents, committees

- Information for legislators includes: name, gender, age, education, election types, (former) occupations, congress number, district, party, electoral competitors (and their biographical information)

- Data also include information on congress size, and ratio of female legislators

As the first project to use these data, [Josh Ryan](https://joshmryan.github.io/) (USU) and I examine the effects of electoral rules on legislative behavior of female and male lawmakers.
