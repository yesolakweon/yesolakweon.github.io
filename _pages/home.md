### Welcome

<dl>
I am Associate Professor of Political Science at <a href="https://www.skku.edu/eng/" style="color: #82E0AA">Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU)</a>. Prior to joining SKKU, I was an assistant professor at <a href="http://www.usu.edu/" style="color: #82E0AA">Utah State University</a>. My research in comparative politics and political economy examines the political causes and consequences of social and economic inequality in post-industrial democracies, with a particular emphasis on East Asia. I explore how the transformations associated with post-industrialization generate new social conflicts and divides, and how these emerging dynamics influence political behavior and reshape public policy. My recent projects explore the politics surrounding three key socio-economic transformations in advanced democracies: 1) population aging and low fertility, 2) gender divisions, and 3) technological advancement. In this context, I analyze political attitudes and electoral choices across different social groups and examine the policy responses of political elites.
