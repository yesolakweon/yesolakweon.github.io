### Welcome

<dl>
I am Assistant Professor of <a href="https://politicalscience.usu.edu/" style="color: #82E0AA">Political Science</a> at <a href="https://www.usu.edu/" style="color: #82E0AA">Utah State University</a>. My research interests are political economy, political behavior, party politics, and welfare policy. Within these broad areas, I study how various political actors respond to new forms of socio-economic risk caused by post-industrial transformations in Western Europe and East Asia. The recent projects examine political behavior of newly marginalized groups and their interaction with political elites in the face of labor market dualization, globalization, and population aging. My work has appeared in journals like <i>Electoral Studies</i>, <i>International Interactions</i>, <i>West European Politics</i> among others. My co-authored book is currently under contract with <i>Oxford University Press</i>.
