### Welcome

<dl>
I am Assistant Professor of <a href="https://politicalscience.usu.edu/" style="color: #82E0AA">Political Science</a> at <a href="https://www.usu.edu/" style="color: #82E0AA">Utah State University</a>. My research interests are political economy, political behavior, and public policy. Within these broad areas, I sutdy how various political actors respond to new forms of socio-economic risk in post-industrial societies. The recent projects examine political behavior of newly marginalized groups and their interaction with political elites in the face of labor market dualization, globalization, and population aging with a focus on Western Europe and East Asia. My work has appeared in journals like <i>Electoral Studies</i>, <i>International Interactions</i>, <i>West European Politics</i> among others. My co-authored book is currently under contract with <i>Oxford University Press</i>.
