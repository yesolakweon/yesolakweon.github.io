### Welcome

I am Assistant Professor of [Political Science](https://politicalscience.usu.edu/) at [Utah State University](https://www.usu.edu/). My research interests are political economy, political behavior, party politics, and welfare politics. Within these broad areas, I study how the interplay between political parties and voters (re-)shapes public policy, and how the existing policy regimes in return affect the relationship between these two actors.

While most of my research focuses on social and labor market policy in advanced industrial democracies, some of my [recent projects](https://yesolakweon.github.io/research/) examine the relationship between service delivery and political legitimacy in non-liberal regimes with a focus on China. Other publications extend my research interests in political economy beyond the topic of welfare politics.
