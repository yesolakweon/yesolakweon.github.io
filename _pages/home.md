### Welcome

<dl>
I am Assistant Professor of <a href="https://politicalscience.usu.edu/" style="color: #82E0AA">Political Science</a> at <a href="https://www.usu.edu/" style="color: #82E0AA">Utah State University</a>. My research interests are international and comparative political economy, political behavior, and public policy with a focus on East Asia. Within these broad fields, I study how new forms of inequality associated with post-industrialization affect the behavior of political actors and in turn, reshape public policy. Recent projects focus on the politics of three important socio-economic transformations in advanced democracies: 1) labor market dualization; 2) gender divisions, and 3) population aging. In this context, I examine the redistributive attitudes and electoral choices of newly marginalized groups as well as the policy responses of political elites.
